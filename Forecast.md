# Forecasting using Dube's method & notation

Suppose you increase the minimum wage by 10%

$$\Delta\text{MW} = 0.1$$

Suppose you have an estimate of the elasticity of employment w.r.t MW

$$\theta_e\left[\,\text{MW}\right] = 0.129$$

Then you can predict the change in employment

$$\Delta e = \theta_e\left[\,\text{MW}\right]\cdot\Delta\text{MW} = 0.0129$$

Thus you can predict that employment will decrease by 1.29%

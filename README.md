## The Dube Report

According to the latest economic evidence, raising the minimum wage has more or less of a negative effect on employment. This is the case for the US, the UK, and many other countries.  
  
  
The [Dube report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/impacts-of-minimum-wages-review-of-the-international-evidence) for the UK government on the minimum wage, for example, estimates that increasing the minimum wage was feasible without causing a significant increase in unemployment.

## Extrapolation

The report states that the minimum wage has no negative impact on unemployment so long as the resulting value of your MW is between 60% and 66% of the median wage.  

This small project is an attempt to extrapolate the Dube report's findings to other countries. 

Have fun exploring the data! ðŸ˜„
